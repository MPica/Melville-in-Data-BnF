# Melville-in-Data-BnF

This repository is meant to store and display the scripts allowing us to query the *Biblioth√®que nationale de France* RDF database.

Our tools are:
* SPARQL, as the RDF query language,
* Python, as a way to communicate with the SPARQL endpoint,
* The SPARQLWrapper library.

This Readme is preliminary and the work is still in progress, which is why this Readme document is so short.
